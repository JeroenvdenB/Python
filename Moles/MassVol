# MassVol : calculations between mass and volume

# subscript formatting only works in python 3.3 or higher, with unicode formatting
# use a typesetting like LaTeX to improve
# random instead of randint is used, because randint is reportedly massively slower

    # d) the type of question (mass to volume or volume to mass) and assemble
